                                        SYX are happy to refund within 30 days for any unsuitable items, provided they are unworn, unwashed and in a resalable condition.

                                        To return to our warehouse, log in to our returns portal and let us know what you want to return and why. Then select your preferred return method to arrange your collection or drop off.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        Our original packaging can be reused but, if you no longer have it, make sure itâ€™s in something watertight. If you can reuse something you have at home, even better!
                                        <br /><br />
                                        You can return more than one order in the same parcel, just make sure that you register a return for each separate order. If you would rather return in store, just show the return in store QR code in your app or order confirmation email.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        Please note that incorrect orders (e.g. wrong or missing items), furniture and lighting can only be returned to our online warehouse.
